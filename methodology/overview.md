# Design Source Methodology

A structured, technology-agnostic framework for designing and building software with AI assistance.

## Philosophy

**If you give an AI structured context and memory, it becomes a reliable collaborator instead of a stateless tool.**

Software development with AI assistants works best when both human and AI operate within a shared, explicit process. Ad-hoc prompting produces inconsistent results. A methodology provides:

- **Predictability** — Both parties know what phase they're in and what's expected
- **Quality** — Defined gates prevent shipping incomplete or untested work
- **Continuity** — Session boundaries don't erase context; decisions are recorded
- **Scalability** — The same process works for a CLI tool, a web app, or a distributed system

## Core Principles

1. **Specification before implementation** — Write down what you're building before writing code
2. **Incremental delivery** — Ship working software in small, verifiable iterations
3. **Decisions are permanent artifacts** — Record architectural choices with rationale
4. **The Project Definition is the source of truth** — All technology-specific details live in one place
5. **Quality gates are non-negotiable** — Every iteration passes the project's defined checks
6. **AI is a collaborator, not an oracle** — The human owns decisions; the AI accelerates execution

## The Iteration Cycle

Every unit of work follows 5 phases:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              1. ANALYZE                  │
│  Understand requirements, break down    │
│  complexity, identify unknowns          │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               2. PLAN                    │
│  Define architecture, structure,        │
│  milestones, and blockers               │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              3. SPECIFY                  │
│  Write technical refinement docs for    │
│  each unit of work                      │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             4. IMPLEMENT                 │
│  Build, test, integrate following       │
│  the specification and plan             │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              5. VERIFY                   │
│  Run quality gates, update docs,        │
│  prepare for delivery                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

         Repeat for each work unit.
```

## How It Works

### For the Human

1. **Fill the Project Definition** — Once per project, describe your tech stack, conventions, and quality gates using the `templates/project/project-definition.md` template (or copy a preset from `presets/`)
2. **Use prompts to drive the AI** — Operation prompts are available as native agent commands (e.g., `/resume-session` in Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) or in `design-source/operations/`
3. **Write specs for each work unit** — Use the specification templates in `templates/specification/` to describe what needs to be built
4. **Follow the phases** — Move through Analyze → Plan → Specify → Implement → Verify for each feature, bugfix, or refactoring

### For the AI Assistant

1. **Read the Project Definition** — Understand the technology stack, conventions, and constraints
2. **Follow the current phase** — Don't skip ahead; each phase has defined inputs and outputs
3. **Reference the methodology** — Use the phase guides in `methodology/phases/` to stay on track
4. **Produce artifacts** — Each phase produces concrete deliverables (specs, plans, code, docs)
5. **Respect quality gates** — Never declare work complete until the project's quality checks pass

## Granularity

The methodology adapts to work of any size:

| Work Size | How to Apply |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Small** (bugfix, typo, config change) | Analyze + Implement + Verify (skip Plan and Specify) |
| **Medium** (new feature, API endpoint) | All 5 phases, single iteration |
| **Large** (new module, major refactor) | All 5 phases, multiple iterations with sub-tasks |
| **Project bootstrap** | Use the `new-project` initialization prompt, then iterate |

## Project Memory Structure

Projects using Design Source maintain a `design-source/` directory at the project root for tracking state across sessions and developers:

```
your-project/
└── design-source/
    ├── memory.md              # Current context — AI reads this first
    ├── project-definition.md  # Technology stack, conventions, quality gates
    ├── operations/            # Operation prompts (only if native agent commands aren't used)
    └── history/
        ├── 001-feature-x.md
        ├── 002-bugfix-y.md
        └── ...
```

### Why This Matters

- **Multi-developer continuity** — Any developer can onboard an AI assistant by pointing it to `design-source/memory.md`
- **Agent portability** — Works with any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor, Codex, and others); switch agents without losing context
- **Session persistence** — Work state survives across chat sessions without manual context restoration
- **Iteration tracking** — Each feature, bugfix, or refactor has its own file with acceptance criteria and task checklists
- **Version controlled** — The entire `design-source/` directory is committed to the repository

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory.md` | Current project state, active work, constraints, and history index. The AI's entry point. |
| `project-definition.md` | Technology stack, conventions, quality gates. The source of truth for how to build. |
| `history/NNN-name.md` | One file per iteration. Contains description, acceptance criteria, task checklist, decisions. |

The initialization prompts (`new-project.md`, `onboard-existing.md`) automatically create and maintain this structure.

## Getting Started

1. Read the [phase guides](phases/) to understand the workflow
2. Use the [new-project prompt](../prompts/initialization/new-project.md) to bootstrap your project with an AI assistant — it will create the Project Definition and memory structure for you
3. For existing projects, use the [onboard-existing prompt](../prompts/initialization/onboard-existing.md) to bring an AI up to speed
4. Follow the iteration cycle for each unit of work, tracking progress in `design-source/history/`
