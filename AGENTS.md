# Stateful Spec — AI Agent Instructions

This project uses the **Stateful Spec** methodology for AI-assisted development.

## Getting Started

1. **Read `.stateful-spec/memory.md`** — your entry point for current project state
2. **Read `.stateful-spec/project-definition.md`** — technology stack, conventions, quality gates
3. **Read `methodology/`** — the full methodology (phases, roles, decision framework). This project IS the methodology source, so read from the root — not from `.stateful-spec/methodology/`.

To **refresh** methodology, prompts, or agent rules from upstream in an already configured repo, use [`prompts/initialization/update-project.md`](prompts/initialization/update-project.md).

## Methodology

Follow the 5-phase iteration cycle: **Analyze → Plan → Specify → Implement → Verify**

- Phase guides: `methodology/phases/`
- Roles and boundaries: `methodology/roles.md`
- Decision framework: `methodology/decision-framework.md`

## Operation Prompts

The following operations are available as Cursor rules (invoke with `@name`):

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `@resume-session` | Resume work — loads project context and picks up where you left off |
| `@save-session` | Save session progress — updates memory.md and iteration files |
| `@create-technical-spec` | Write a technical specification for new work |
| `@write-tests` | Generate tests for existing or new code |
| `@debug-issue` | Diagnose and fix a bug with structured root cause analysis |
| `@refactor-code` | Safely restructure code without changing behavior |
| `@review-changes` | Self-review code changes before committing |
| `@write-commit-message` | Generate a well-structured commit message |
| `@update-documentation` | Update docs after implementing a change |

## Rules for All Work

1. All content must follow the conventions in the Project Definition
2. All quality gates must pass before work is considered complete
3. Do not introduce patterns or structures not in the Project Definition without discussing first
4. When modifying existing content, minimize the diff — prefer targeted changes over rewrites
5. Make small, logical commits that leave the repository in a working state
6. Track iterations in `.stateful-spec/history/` and keep `.stateful-spec/memory.md` current

### Iteration tracking

For every **non-trivial** work unit (feature, bugfix, refactor, methodology or documentation change driven by a plan or spec), **before** substantive implementation:

- Create `.stateful-spec/history/NNN-[kebab-name].md` using [`templates/implementation/iteration.md`](templates/implementation/iteration.md), where `NNN` is the next number after existing files in `history/`.
- Update **Active Work** and **History Index** in `.stateful-spec/memory.md` when starting; move completed work to **Recent Completions** when done.

**Trivial** edits may skip a new iteration file (e.g. typo fix, obvious one-line correction with no acceptance criteria). When in doubt, create an iteration file — it keeps `@save-session` and audits straightforward.

If the session **starts with a direct task** (e.g. "implement this plan") instead of a full `@resume-session` dialog, still create or attach to an iteration file **before** implementing — see `prompts/operations/resume-session.md` (direct-task entry).
