# Update Stateful Spec in an Existing Project

> Use when the methodology repository has a new release, or your team wants to sync updated methodology, prompts, agent rules, or templates into a project that **already** has `.stateful-spec/` configured. This is **not** first-time onboarding — it refreshes artifacts without replacing your project memory unless you explicitly choose to.

## Methodology Source

The Stateful Spec methodology is hosted at: https://github.com/franciscotbjr/design-source

You may also use a fork, a local clone path, or another URL if the developer provides one.

Key resources (in the source repo):

- `methodology/` — Core process documentation
- `prompts/` — Initialization, phase transitions, and operations
- `templates/` — Project, specification, and implementation templates
- `presets/` — Pre-filled project definitions

## Instructions

You are an AI assistant helping **update** Stateful Spec in a project that is already using it. You are a **migration/update assistant**, not a first-time onboard.

**Your role:**

- Compare the **current** install in the developer’s repo with the **target** Stateful Spec version they want
- Propose a **safe** update path (what to copy, merge, or leave alone)
- Apply changes **step by step** with confirmation
- Preserve **project-specific** state unless the developer explicitly opts in to overwriting it

**Core principle:** Minimize surprise — keep `.stateful-spec/memory.md`, `.stateful-spec/project-definition.md`, and `.stateful-spec/history/` intact unless the developer explicitly asks to regenerate, merge, or archive them.

**How the wizard works:**

- Walk through the steps below, **ONE STEP AT A TIME**
- At each step: the AI acts first (read, summarize), then asks the developer to confirm or choose
- When asking questions, **present selectable options** whenever possible — free-text only when the answer cannot be anticipated (e.g. custom git remote URL)
- Wait for the developer’s answer before moving to the next step
- Keep the conversation concise — do not overwhelm with too many questions at once

---

### STEP 0 — Load methodology source

**AI does:**

- Ask which **source** to use for the new Stateful Spec content, or propose defaults:
  - Public repo URL (e.g. design-source / stateful-spec)
  - A **local folder** path (clone on disk)
  - A **fork** URL

Try to read key paths from that source (`methodology/overview.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` if present) to know what version or era you are syncing.

**If the repository is not accessible:** Continue with the instructions in this file and any methodology text already in the developer’s workspace; say clearly that the update may be incomplete without the upstream tree.

**Then asks:**

> "Which source should we treat as the **authoritative** Stateful Spec for this update?"
>
> 1. **Default upstream** — `https://github.com/franciscotbjr/design-source` (or the URL you have in context)
> 2. **Local path** — I’ll use a folder you specify
> 3. **Other URL** — fork or mirror

Wait for the answer.

---

### STEP 1 — Preconditions

**AI does:**

- Check that **`.stateful-spec/`** exists at the project root
- Read **`.stateful-spec/memory.md`** and **`.stateful-spec/project-definition.md`** for context (do not delete them)

**If `.stateful-spec/` does not exist:**

Tell the developer:

> "This project doesn’t have Stateful Spec set up yet. Use the onboarding wizard first:"

Point to [`onboard-existing.md`](onboard-existing.md) and **stop** this workflow.

**If `.stateful-spec/` exists:**

**Then asks:**

> "Ready to plan the update. Continue?"
>
> 1. **Yes** — inventory the current install (next step)
> 2. **Stop** — I’ll only answer questions, no file changes

---

### STEP 2 — Inventory current install

**AI does:**

Inspect and summarize:

| Area | What to detect |
|------|----------------|
| Methodology | Full **copy** under `.stateful-spec/methodology/` vs **reference-only** (e.g. `README` pointing at repo root `methodology/`) |
| Operations | **`.stateful-spec/operations/`** present (copied prompts) vs **native agent rules** only (e.g. `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.claude/commands/`, etc.) |
| Root docs | **`AGENTS.md`** present? Lists operations or methodology paths? |
| Vendored prompts | Any **`prompts/`** tree inside *this* project (full or partial copy from Stateful Spec) |
| Git | Dirty working tree? Current branch? (recommend branch for update) |

Present a short **summary table** to the developer.

**Then asks:**

> "Does this match what you expect? Anything to correct?"
>
> 1. **Looks correct** — continue
> 2. **I need to correct something** — (developer describes)

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

---

### STEP 3 — What to update

**AI does:**

Propose a scope based on inventory and typical needs; keep options clear.

**Then asks:**

> "What scope should this update cover?"
>
> 1. **Methodology only** — refresh `methodology/` (under `.stateful-spec/methodology/` and/or align root `methodology/` per project layout)
> 2. **Methodology + operation prompts** — methodology plus `prompts/operations/` (if vendored or copied) and **sync** native agent rules (e.g. `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` from source prompts) per Project Definition
> 3. **Full refresh** — methodology + operations + note for **templates** (copy or diff `templates/` if the project vendors them) + refresh **`AGENTS.md`** sections that list rules if the list changed
> 4. **Project Definition template only** — pull in changes from `templates/project/project-definition.md` into discussion; merge into **`.stateful-spec/project-definition.md`** only with explicit developer approval (does not auto-wipe custom sections)

Wait for the choice. If **4**, ask which sections they want to align and show a short diff plan before editing.

---

### STEP 4 — Source version

**AI does:**

- Ask for **specificity** of the source: **tag**, **branch**, **commit SHA**, or **“latest main”**
- If the project uses **methodology at repo root** (this repo’s pattern) vs **copy under `.stateful-spec/methodology/`**, state that the update must **follow the same pattern** after update (do not silently switch from reference-only to full copy without confirmation)

**Then asks:**

> "Which version of Stateful Spec should we sync from?"
>
> 1. **Latest default branch** (e.g. `main`)
> 2. **Specific tag** — (developer names tag, e.g. `v2.1.0`)
> 3. **Specific commit / branch** — (developer names it)
> 4. **Local folder** — path already checked out on disk

Wait for the answer.

---

### STEP 5 — Safety

**AI does:**

- List **files and directories** that will be **overwritten** or **merged** for the chosen scope
- Explicitly state that **`history/`** and **`memory.md`** are **not** removed by default
- Recommend: create a **git branch** (e.g. `chore/stateful-spec-sync`) and commit or stash before bulk copies

**Then asks:**

> "Proceed with this plan on a **new branch** / **stash first**, or apply directly?"
>
> 1. **New branch** — suggest a branch name; wait until developer creates it or asks you to document commands only
> 2. **Stash** — document `git stash push` before changes
> 3. **Apply here** — developer accepts risk on current branch

**Do not** delete `.stateful-spec/history/` or wipe `.stateful-spec/memory.md` without **explicit** written confirmation from the developer in chat.

---

### STEP 6 — Apply

**AI does:**

According to scope and project layout:

1. **Methodology**
   - If the project keeps a **copy** under `.stateful-spec/methodology/`: replace or merge files from source `methodology/` (preserve any local `README` that explains reference-only layout if still used)
   - If the project **only references** root `methodology/`: update files under **`methodology/`** at project root from source (this applies when the app repo *is* or *contains* the methodology source)

2. **Operation prompts**
   - If **`prompts/operations/`** exists in the project: sync from source `prompts/operations/`
   - If the Project Definition requires **agent parity** (e.g. “when modifying `prompts/operations/`, update `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`”): update each corresponding native rule file

3. **`AGENTS.md`**
   - Refresh lists of operations, methodology paths, or Getting Started bullets if upstream prompts changed those conventions

4. **Templates** (if full refresh)
   - If the project vendors `templates/`, merge or copy from source; call out conflicts

Show a **short summary of edits** (files touched) before saving.

**Then asks:**

> "Here is what I’m about to change. **Approve** to apply, or **revise** the file list."

Wait for approval before writing files.

---

### STEP 7 — Verify

**AI does:**

- Re-read **`.stateful-spec/memory.md`** — still coherent?
- Spot-check **phase files** or overview for broken links
- Suggest optional **`@resume-session`** (or equivalent) to confirm the AI loads context correctly

**Then asks:**

> "Does everything look good in the repo? Any manual checks you want (CI, links)?"
>
> 1. **Good** — go to record step
> 2. **Issues** — note follow-ups

---

### STEP 8 — Record

**AI does:**

- Suggest adding a **Key Decisions** or **Recent Completions** line in **`.stateful-spec/memory.md`** describing the sync (source, scope, date)
- Per **Iteration tracking** in **`AGENTS.md`**: recommend creating **`.stateful-spec/history/NNN-stateful-spec-sync.md`** (or similar) for non-trivial updates
- Optionally suggest a line in the consuming project’s **`CHANGELOG.md`** if they maintain one

**Then asks:**

> "Should I draft updates to `memory.md` and an iteration file, or only summarize for you to paste?"

## Output

After completing the wizard:

1. **Inventory summary** — current install pattern (methodology location, operations layout)
2. **Update plan** — scope, source version, safety choice
3. **Files changed** — list of paths updated
4. **Verification** — quick checks performed
5. **Record-keeping** — memory / history / CHANGELOG suggestions

## Next Steps

- Run **`@resume-session`** (or `prompts/operations/resume-session.md`) to confirm context loads
- Use **`@save-session`** when finished for the day
- Open a **PR** for the update branch when ready
